Desktop/laptop Serval client and node software.

This project is being started as part of the RightsCon 2014 UX sprint.
See the following URL for more information:

The overall goal is to make a cross-platform client for the Serval Mesh that can run on Windows, Linux
and OSX.

We are pre-populating this repository with some sample code in Python that demonstrates how to talk to
the Serval Daemon, and provide a bit of example material to help hang mental coats on.
